# Login-Signup-PHP
in this tutorial we will see how to create a login and signup pages in PHP.
for this I have created two pages :

1. login.php (which will help us login using data we provide while sign up)
2. 1. signup.php (which will help us feed data in sql database)

also i have created a database in myphphadmin where:
1. database name = nimo
2. table name= signup
3. column = id, name, email, number, sex, pwd

I linked the signup.php and login.php with same database to send and retrive data.
after postback user enter the login value data.
